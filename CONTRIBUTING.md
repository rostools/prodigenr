Before getting into too much detail, I wanted to get into some detail about the
aim of this package (and future packages). The aim is to provide a toolkit that
automates and simplifies the process of having an open scientific workflow, 
particularly for those in the biomedical/health fields. One of the challenges of
being open is that it is hard to start doing, it's still so new and in constant
discussion and development, and there are not a lot of resources for those in
biomedical/health research for learning about it. This project hopes to start
working towards fixing those issues.

I am looking for any and all ideas and contributions. Mostly this project needs
help on the R development side, the user interface side, and for ideas on what 
needs to be included to simplify doing open science.

This document is still in development, so bear with me :)
