# Contents of doc folder

The doc folder contains the main scientific product of the project as well as all
other files related to it (e.g. co-author comments, versions, images, etc). It may and
likely should also contain supplementary and exploratory R Markdown files. Once
submission or presentation time has come for the product, files associated with
that process (e.g. response to reviewers) should be placed in here.
