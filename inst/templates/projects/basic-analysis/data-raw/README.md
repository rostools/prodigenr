# Contents of data folder

Should contain the *raw* (unedited) data used specifically for the
scientific project and product (e.g. the manuscript).

While ideally the original raw data used for the project should be
stored here, this isn't always possible. At the minimum, include
instructions on how to access the raw data or where it came from.
