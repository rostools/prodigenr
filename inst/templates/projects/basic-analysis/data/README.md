# Contents of data folder

Should contain the data used specifically for the scientific project
and product (e.g. the manuscript). 

Ideally the cleaned and processed data used for the project should be
included here, however, this isn't always possible. At the least, a
simulated or fake dataset of the original should be included to ensure
that the code used in this project runs as intended.

Results generated from any analyses that are part of the project
should also be stored here as data files. Saving the results here
has the advantage that you don't have to always re-run analyses and
that they can be inspected by reviewers or other researchers to
verify the findings.
