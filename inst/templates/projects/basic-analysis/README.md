# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, docs and R folders.

The following folders contain:

- `data/`:
-   `docs/`:
- `R/`:

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using `usethis::use_package("packagename")`
through the `DESCRIPTION` file, installing dependencies is as easy as opening the
`{{ProjectName}}.Rproj` file and running this command in the console:

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_deps()

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

documentation.
