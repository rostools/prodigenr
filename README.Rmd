This [R] package is part of a [series][rostools-github] of (planned) packages that are aimed at
creating a toolkit for doing reproducible and open science. Many researchers 
(especially in biomedicine, medicine, or health, which is my area of research)
have little to no knowledge on what open science is or what reproducibility is,
let alone how to do it. Our goal is create an [(opinionated) toolkit][rostools-manifesto] to automate
and simplify the process of doing open and reproducible science.

This package has a simple aim of being a *pro*ject *di*rectory *gen*erato*r*
(prodigenr), with a simple focus on:

1. Creating a standardized project folder structure with a few template files
needed for beginning a data analysis project
2. Following a "one project, one (main) output" principle, such as a
report/manuscript in the case of scientific output or a book or website for things
like courses or workshops
3. Adhering to established best practices that make it easier for the project to
be reproducible and open

This standardized approach to how a scientific project is structured helps ensure
that the final code and documents are fairly modular, self-contained, easy to share
and make public, and be as reproducible as possible. The structure also
makes use of the existing and established applications and workflows ([RStudio],
[devtools], and [usethis]). 

## Installation

You can install the released version of prodigenr from [CRAN] with:

``` r
install.packages("prodigenr")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rostools/prodigenr")
```

## Usage

There are two ways of creating a new project: using the R console or using the
RStudio "New Project" menu option.

Through the console, use the `setup_project()` command.  So, for instance, if you
want a manuscript project, type out:

``` r
library(prodigenr)
setup_project("~/Desktop/DiseaseDiet")
```

This then creates a directory tree, with template files for starting
your analysis! Open the newly created project via the `.Rproj` file. For the
RStudio approach, go to "File -> New Project", then "New directory" and find the
prodigenr project in the list:

![Creating a prodigenr project in RStudio](man/figures/rstudio-projects.gif)

Once in the project, you can add a manuscript R Markdown file using:

``` r
create_manuscript() 
```

The main secondary function is the `template_list` command, which lists the
available template files (submit a PR if you want another template included!):

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(prodigenr)
```

```{r}
template_list
```

<!-- TODO: Add gif for using RStudio "new file" -->

For a more detailed tutorial, see the introduction vignette:

```r
vignette('prodigenr', 'prodigenr')
```

## Related packages or projects

There are several existing packages for creating projects, each of which has
it's own pros and cons. Check out the last section of the `vignette("prodigenr")`
for more details. Try them out and see which you like!

prodigenr tries to use ideas from R packages/[devtools] while still being as simple
as possible and to be more specific to academic researchers primarily in
biomedical/non-computer science fields. However, it can always improve! I
welcome any suggestions, just submit a 
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/rostools/prodigenr/issues).
