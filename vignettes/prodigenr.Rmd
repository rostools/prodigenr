prodigenr, or *pro*ject *di*rectory *gen*erator, was designed to
simplify the process of creating new scientific data analysis projects
and to help make your workflow more reproducible and open from the
beginning. While creating individual folders and files manually for new
projects doesn't take too much time, over time and over many
researchers, this can quickly add up to a lot of time! Plus, when a
standard structure is followed it makes it easier to share code and
establish reproducible practices earlier on in the project.

## Setting up a project with prodigenr

Starting a research project? Create a project directory like so:

```{r manuscript-proj}
library(prodigenr)
# Create a temporary folder using the fs package
new_project_path <- fs::path_temp("HeartDiseaseExercise")
setup_project(new_project_path)
```

Or via RStudio's interface (with RStudio version \>1.1):

![Creating a prodigenr project in
RStudio](../man/figures/rstudio-projects.gif)

The resulting file structure should look something like this:

```{r folder-tree, echo=FALSE, comment="", results="markup"}
prodigenr:::viz_project_tree(new_project_path)
```

`README.md` files are contained within each project and in each folder
that explains a bit more about what each folder and file are used for,
which is briefly described here:

-   `R/`: Should contain the R scripts and functions used for the
    analysis.
-   `docs/`: Should contain the files related to presenting the
    project's scientific output. Already has the report/manuscript
    inside.
-   `data/`: If relevant, is where the processed (or simulated) data is
    kept that is used for the project as well as the results of the
    project's analyses.
-   `data-raw/`: If relevant, is where the scripts that process the raw
    data into the usable data are kept and, optionally where the raw
    data is also kept.
-   `DESCRIPTION`: Is a standard file that includes metadata about your
    project, in a machine readable format, and that also stores a list
    of the R packages your project depends on.
-   `.Rproj`: Is a standard file used by RStudio to set some R Project
    specific settings.

To add a new document (e.g. slides, manuscript), run any of the
`create_*()` commands (e.g. `create_slides()`) in the console while in
RStudio in the newly created project (via the `.Rproj` file):

```{r example-create-function, eval=FALSE}
# you need to run these in the project's console
create_slides()
```

```{r example-create-functions-hide, echo=FALSE}
# you need to run these in the project's console
withr::with_dir(
  new = new_project_path,
  code = {
    create_slides()
  }
)
```

Now two more files have been added to the `docs/` folder. The resulting
file structure should look something like this:

```{r file-structure-with-doc, echo=FALSE, results="markup", comment=""}
withr::with_dir(fs::path_temp(), {
  fs::dir_tree(basename(new_project_path))
})
```

At present, there are only two template files that you can view:

```{r templates}
template_list
```

These template files are what an academic researcher likely typically
encounters. However, if you have a suggestion or want to add a template,
please create a [Github
issue](https://github.com/rostools/prodigenr/issues) or submit a [Pull
Request](https://github.com/rostools/prodigenr/pulls)!

The end goal of each project is to be as self contained as possible. So
that if you ever need to go back to the analysis, it is easy to re-run
the code and get the results that you say you got. This is especially
useful if others such as reviewers ask for something or want to confirm
your results. See the [manifesto](https://rostools.gitlab.io/manifesto)
for more details on the underlying philosophy behind this package.

## Related packages or projects

There are several ways of handling a project. There a few packages that
have similar functionality as `prodigenr` package structure:

-   [`ProjectTemplate`](http://projecttemplate.net/) is well documented
    and still actively developed. Only downside is that it is fairly
    complicated to use and complex in the project workflow it creates.
-   [`makeProject`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=makeProject) is
    very simple and stripped down in what it creates and in it's use.
    Downside is that it wasn't updated since 2012.
-   Use of the R package structure via
    [`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools) (or
    [`usethis`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=usethis)), which is
    argued for in this
    [blog](https://rmflight.github.io/posts/2014/07/vignetteAnalysis.html)
    and compared to `ProjectTemplate` in this
    [blog](https://rmflight.github.io/posts/2014/07/zpackages_vs_projectTemplate.html)).
-   [`rrtools`](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) is very similar
    to prodigenr, except it focuses only on manuscripts. Is well thought
    out and the documentation is well written.
-   [`workflowr`](https://github.com/workflowr/workflowr) is a workflow
    for creating online, data science content.

There is also a list of other similar projects [on the rOpenSci GitHub
repository](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg#useful-tools-and-templates-for-making-research-compendia).
It's up to you to decide which style to use.

```{r remove-created-project, include=FALSE}
fs::dir_delete(new_project_path)
```
