# prodigenr (development version)

## Minor changes

- Removed Distill from imports and from created report, switching to using Quarto
instead (e.g. with YAML metadata).
- Removed AppVeyor.
- Rearranged project creation to copy an internal folder (with necessary files)
into the specified folder on the users computer. This hopefully will make it easier
to add other templates later on.
- Updated package aims to be clearer and more focused.

# prodigenr 0.6.1

## Bug fix

- DESCRIPTION file actually needs a `Package` field (#127).

# prodigenr 0.6.0

## Major changes

- Removed abstract and poster templates. Abstracts are so small it isn't
an important addition and (I sense) posters will for a while be created
with other software tools (e.g. PowerPoint). Plus there aren't many 
mature and well-established poster packages in R at this point in time.
- Tidied up and trim down all the README files and include pointers to
the prodigenr online documentation instead.
- Removed R script template files. Projects might be too diverse for
these template scripts to make sense.
- Removed several dependencies, including the usethis package.
- Moved Git initialization setup out into new function called `setup_with_git()`.

# prodigenr 0.5.0

## Major change

- Switch to having only one argument for `setup_project()` called `path` (#102)

## Additions

- Can now use RStudio's "New Project" interface for a GUI creation of the project (#109, #111)
- Setup projects to be "blank slates" (i.e. don't save `.RData`) (#105)
- Add TODO list to project to complete after project creation (#39)

## Hotfix

- Fix NOTES in CRAN results check for unused dependencies (clipr, desc, devtools)

## Misc

- Remove deprecated `prodigen()` function (#107)
- Replace current interactive messaging with `usethis::ui_*` functions
- Reduced opinionated content and moved over to [rostools](https://github.com/rostools/rostools)
and its [manifesto](https://gitlab.com/rostools/manifesto) (#108)
- Removed some dependencies by using functions from usethis
- Incorporate `use_template()` instead of custom function (#101)

## New features/functionality

* `prodigen()` now creates a new project structure that mimics R package development
more, specifically `devtools` (since it is well documented and actively
maintained) (#18, #15, #14). The old style has been removed.
* Added a function to include a [STROBE](https://www.strobe-statement.org/index.php?id=strobe-home) 
checklist for  reporting guidelines (#21).
